# Spring Core
One of the fundamental parts of Spring that includes foundational capabilities. One of these features is the Spring context.

# Foundation of Spring
Spring works based on the principle of *Inversion of control* or *IoC*. Fundamentally *IoC* principle is instead of allowing app to control the execution, we give control to some other piece of software i.e. Spring framework in this case. Spring controls the execution through configurations we instruct the framework on how to manage the code we write, which defines the logic of the app. ***We don't let the app control the execution by its own code and use dependencies. Instead we allow framework(the depenendency) to control the app and its code*.**
